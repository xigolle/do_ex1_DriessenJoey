# Vagrant
This repo will hold a vagrant file and is used to experiment with Vagrant. 
The Vagrant will setup a Ubuntu webserver with Apache, MySQL and PHP installed (LAMP).

##How does it work:

1.  Download or clone repo
2. Install vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/)
3. Run bash from this folder(repo)
4. first run the `vagrant up` command. 
5. After this command run succesfull run the `vagrant provision` command **Only run this if `vagrant up ` doesnt do this automaticly**
6. Now you have a vragrant machine running and you can ssh to it with the command `vagrant ssh`.
